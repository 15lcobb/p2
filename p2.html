      <font size ="1"><left><p id="x">The llama (/ˈlɑːmə/; Spanish: [ˈʝama] locally [ˈʎama] or [ˈʒama]) (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era.<br> The height of a full-grown, full-size llama is 1.7 to 1.8 m (5.6 to 5.9 ft) tall at the top of the head, and can weigh between 130 and 200 kg (290 and 440 lb).<br> At birth, a baby llama (called a cria) can weigh between 9 and 14 kg (20 and 31 lb).<br> Llamas typically live for 15 to 25 years, with some individuals surviving 30 years or more.<br> They are very social animals and live with other llamas as a herd.<br> The wool produced by a llama is very soft and lanolin-free.<br> Llamas are intelligent and can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions.<br> When using a pack, they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km (5–8 miles).<br> The name llama (in the past also spelled 'lama' or 'glama') was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians.<br> Llamas appear to have originated from the central plains of North America about 40 million years ago.<br> They migrated to South America about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange.<br> By the end of the last ice age (10,000–12,000 years ago), camelids were extinct in North America.<br> As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in South America, and due to importation from South America in the late 20th century, there are now over 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas in the United States and Canada</p></left></font>

      <h2>alpacas</h2>         
      <font size ="1"><left><p id="a">The alpaca (Vicugna pacos) is a domesticated species of South American camelid. Alpacas are similar to llamas, and are often confused with them. The two animals are closely related, and can successfully cross-breed. They are also closely related to the vicuña, which is believed to be the alpaca's wild ancestor, and to the guanaco.<br> There are two breeds of alpaca: the Suri alpaca and the Huacaya alpaca.<br> Alpacas are kept in herds that graze on the level heights of the Andes of southern Peru, western Bolivia, Ecuador, and northern Chile at an altitude of 3,500 m (11,500 ft) to 5,000 m (16,000 ft) above sea level, throughout the year.<br> Alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas, and unlike llamas, they were not bred to be beasts of burden, but were bred specifically for their fiber.<br> Alpaca fiber is used for making knitted and woven items, similar to wool.<br> These items include blankets, sweaters, hats, gloves, scarves, a wide variety of textiles and ponchos in South America, and sweaters, socks, coats and bedding in other parts of the world.<br> The fiber comes in more than 52 natural colors as classified in Peru, 12 as classified in Australia and 16 as classified in the United States.<br> Alpacas have several different components to how they behave.<br> They depend on their body communication to get their point across when they are threatened or happy.<br> They spit when they are in distress, fearful, or to show dominance.<br> Male alpacas tend to behave more aggressively than females, and they try to establish dominance of their herd group.<br> In the textile industry, "alpaca" primarily refers to the hair of Peruvian alpacas, but more broadly it refers to a style of fabric originally made from alpaca hair, but now often made from similar fibers, such as mohair, Icelandic sheep wool, or even high-quality wool. In trade, distinctions are made between alpacas and the several styles of mohair and luster.<br> An adult alpaca generally is between 81–99 centimetres (32–39 in) in height at the shoulders (withers).<br> They usually weigh 48–84 kilograms (106–185 lb). </p></left></font>
